# Mobile OpenCV RGBD Odometry #

This sample demonstrates how easy it is to integrate OpenCV's RGBD odometry into a minimal sample project from the Structure SDK. Currently, there is no visualization of the odometry result (it's just printed to the console). You can roll your own VR or AR game, or even do some large scale mapping.

For more information about the Structure Sensor and the Structure SDK, visit [this website](http://structure.io/).

Not included is a binary of opencv2.framework that includes the RGBD module. You can download a binary of pre-alpha 3.0 [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l9yu7hzv9j3d5qh/opencv2.framework.zip)
